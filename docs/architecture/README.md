# Love Ledger Architecture Documentation

Welcome to the Love Ledger architecture documentation. This documentation provides a comprehensive understanding of the system design, data flow, and technical implementation of the Love Ledger application.

## Quick Start for New Developers

If you're new to the Love Ledger codebase, we recommend reading the documents in this order:

1. **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Start here to understand the core concepts and tech stack
2. **[USER_FLOWS.md](./USER_FLOWS.md)** - Learn how Producers and Consumers interact with the app
3. **[DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md)** - Understand the data model and entity relationships
4. **[SUPABASE.md](./SUPABASE.md)** - Learn about backend integration and authentication
5. **[COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md)** - Familiarize yourself with UI component patterns
6. **[DATA_FLOW.md](./DATA_FLOW.md)** - Deep dive into how data moves through the system

## Documentation Index

### System Overview

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)** | High-level system overview including the Love Ledger concept, Producer/Consumer model, technology stack (Next.js 15, React 19, Supabase, PostGIS), project structure, and key terminology |

### User Experience

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[USER_FLOWS.md](./USER_FLOWS.md)** | Detailed user journeys for both Producers and Consumers, including step-by-step flows for creating posts, browsing locations, matching to avatars, responding, and conversing |

### Backend & Data

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[DATABASE.md](./DATABASE.md)** | Entity-relationship documentation with table structures, relationships between profiles/locations/posts/conversations/messages/notifications, indexes, PostGIS geospatial features, triggers, and TypeScript type integration |
| **[SUPABASE.md](./SUPABASE.md)** | Supabase integration guide covering client setup (browser/server/middleware), authentication flow, session management, selfie storage with access control, Row Level Security (RLS) policies, and real-time subscription patterns |
| **[DATA_FLOW.md](./DATA_FLOW.md)** | Data flow architecture explaining how data moves from UI to Supabase and back, including Next.js App Router patterns, state management strategies, real-time updates, optimistic updates, and end-to-end type safety |

### Frontend & Components

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[COMPONENTS.md](./COMPONENTS.md)** | UI component architecture including component organization, reusable primitives (Button, Input, Modal), variant/size systems, styling patterns with Tailwind CSS, accessibility features, and type definitions |

## Key Concepts at a Glance

### The Love Ledger Model

Love Ledger is a **location-based "missed connections"** dating application where:

- **Producers** leave digital notes at physical locations for people they've noticed
- **Consumers** browse locations and respond to posts that match their appearance
- **Avatar-based anonymity** protects privacy until both parties consent to connect

### Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| **Backend** | Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime) |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial queries |
| **Avatars** | Avataaars library for customizable avatar representations |

### Core Entities

```
profiles ─┬─► posts ─┬─► conversations ─► messages
          │         │
          │         └─► (target_avatar, selfie_url)
          │
          └─► notifications
                    │
locations ─────────►│
```
