-- ============================================================================
-- Location Visits Schema Migration
-- ============================================================================
-- This migration creates the location_visits table for tracking user visits
-- to physical venues. Users can only create posts at locations they have
-- physically visited within the last 3 hours.
--
-- Key features:
-- - Tracks when users visit locations (within 50m proximity)
-- - Stores visit coordinates and GPS accuracy for verification
-- - Enables visit-based filtering for post creation eligibility
-- - Automatic cleanup of visits older than 3 hours (privacy)

-- Index for querying a user's visits by time (most common query pattern)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_visits_user_id ON location_visits(user_id);

-- Index for location-based queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_visits_location_id ON location_visits(location_id);

-- Composite index for user's recent visits (sorted by visit time)
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_visits_user_visited_at
    ON location_visits(user_id, visited_at DESC);

-- Composite index for unique user-location-time queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_visits_user_location
    ON location_visits(user_id, location_id, visited_at DESC);

-- Index on created_at for cleanup operations
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_location_visits_created_at ON location_visits(created_at DESC);
