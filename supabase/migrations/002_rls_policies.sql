-- Love Ledger Row Level Security Policies
-- Migration: 002_rls_policies.sql
-- Description: Implements RLS policies for all tables to ensure proper data access control
-- Security Model:
--   - Profiles: Read all, modify own only
--   - Locations: Read all, create when authenticated
--   - Posts: Read all active, modify own only
--   - Conversations: Only visible to participants (producer/consumer)
--   - Messages: Only visible to conversation participants
--   - Notifications: Only visible to owner

-- ============================================================================
-- ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY ON ALL TABLES
-- ============================================================================
